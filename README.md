README adjs CHILDES data

This folder contains the adj_adj sequences from the adj_adj_n strings in the CHILDES dataset for each relevant age (2-3, 3-4, 4-5) as well as the lexical class distinction and subjectivity score for each adjective.

Some notes:

-Adj_adj data has both child-directed and child-produced data for each age.

-Both adjectives in each adj_adj string must contain adjectives that have both lexical class disnction and subjectivity score (did not count adjs with designation 'other').

-We assumed that subectivity scores were relatively equal to each other if they were within 0.1 

-Hypothesis scores were calculated in log base e
